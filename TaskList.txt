MILESTONE 2:
1. Finish cockpit driver view 
2. Work on Collaborative Control file
3. Gather information on Scenario Runner


MILESTONE 3:
1. Implement Reactive Dashboard
	a. With Speedometer
	b. With Steering Wheel
2. Ensure ScenarioRunner works consistently
	a. If it doesn't work, create a file like "generate_traffic.py" where we can manipulate the behavior of other actors
3. Refine "collaborative_control.py"
	a. Allow 50/50 input for user and autopilot input
		i. If this is completed, refine further to where human input always wins over autopilot.
4. Investigate Haptic Feedback for Logitech G29 steering wheel.
	a. Most likely something has to be put into the code to allow the steering wheel's haptic feedback to be enabled.
